### Titanic Passenger Survival Prediction by Classification Model

This is my submission for the Kaggle Titanic Prediction Competition. Complete Data preprocessing, cleaning, variable selections, exloratory data analysis and then 3 Differnet models are built with three different alorithms for maximizing the accuracy. Three models being
* Logistic Regression:87.0229%
* Linear Discriminant Analysis:87.0229%
* KNN:88.1679%
with KNN giving us the maximum accuracy

* Download the notebook and the dataset
* Change the path to the dataset according to the location you have saved the dataset
* Open run the notebook in Jupyter

Note: If the notebook doesnt render in github because of an angoing issue with github just [click here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/naikshubham14/Machine-learning-and-data-analytics/blob/main/Titanic%20Survival%20Classification/Classification%20-%20Titanic%20Dataset.ipynb)
